        <p>All scheduling of office visits is done by the Reception Desk. All scheduling of surgeries is done by the appropriate doctor’s nurse or physician’s assistant.</p>
        <p>Except in the case of emergencies, it is not our policy to see patients without an appointment. Our doctors fill their schedules well in advance with, in some cases, people who have waited months to make an appointment. We understand that it is tempting to bring someone with you in hopes that they can be seen as well during your appointment time, but in fairness to those who have waited, we are not able to see anyone without a scheduled appointment. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.</p>
